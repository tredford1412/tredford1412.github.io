## Projects

**FitnessAI (Software Engineer Passion Project)** — *July 2025 – Present*  
Integrated Python and machine learning to automate workout plans from user time/goal constraints. Currently building a mobile app (iOS/Android) with Swift + JavaScript and Python back end.

**mRNA Prediction Model — Arcturus Therapeutics** — *Jan 2025 – Mar 2025*  
Built mRNA secondary-structure prediction pipelines using EternaFold, EternaBench, Arnie, ViennaRNA, and RNAfold in Linux/Python to support R&D. Streamlined evaluation of folding/stability to guide mRNA design.


**BENG 183: Applied Genomic Technologies — RNA-Seq Alignment** — *Nov – Dec 2024*  
Co-presented a lecture on RNA-seq alignment tools STAR and TopHat2. Compared alignment efficiency and computational performance between methods.

**BIMM 143: Introductory Bioinformatics Lab — Find-A-Gene Project** — *Jan – March 2025*  
Analyzed the novel protein “Malate Dehydrogenase” from *Panagrolaimus* using multiple sequence alignment, heatmaps, phylogenetic trees, and 3-D structural modeling.

## Experience

**Research Assistant — Herzik Lab, UC San Diego** — *Sept 2025 – Present*  
Molecular cloning workflows (competent cells, bacterial transformation, Gibson Assembly, mini-preps); PCR, gels, DNA extraction to verify constructs for downstream biochemical and cryo-EM analysis. Assisted with cryo-EM sample prep and data collection toward mechanisms of organelle compartmentalization.

**Scientific Intern — Arcturus Therapeutics** — *Jun 2024 – Mar 2025*  
Characterized plasmid DNA isoforms via HPLC to guide IVT workflows. Contributed to FLD-based impurity detection, built mRNA structure models, ran pDNA purification workflows, and managed multiple projects independently.

**Research Assistant — Alotaibi Lab, UC San Diego** — *Feb 2024 – Jun 2025*  
Performed metabolomics and biomarker analyses (mass spectrometry) for CTEPH. Analyzed complex datasets with the team to identify therapeutic avenues. Obtained informed consent and coordinated blood sample collection with CTEPH patients at UCSD Jacobs Medical Center.
